# Interview Katas

Following the Guardian's [example](https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2016/jan/20/the-guardians-new-pairing-exercises) of publishing their interview tests, we are publishing our tests. No advantage can be gained by reviewing these ahead of time, we will be interested in the _how_ rather than the _what_ you do.

Different roles will have different interviewing techniques and criteria, and you will be advised of this as part of the application process.
